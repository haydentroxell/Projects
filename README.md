# Project2-Memory.zip
This project is a simple memory card game that uses a interactive GUI to allow the player to select two cards and the program will check if the cards are matching. If the cards are matching then the cards will disappear. If the cards are not matching then the two cards will be flipped back over and the player will be able to select two more cards to check.
